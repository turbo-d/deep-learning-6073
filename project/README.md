# Final Group Project

The final project was to work together as a group to reproduce a modern deep learning paper
of our choosing, present the work to the class, and write a review paper based on our learnings.

We chose to reproduce the downbeat tracking results from the paper
[SpecTNT: a Time-Frequency Transformer for Music Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09127). The goal
of downbeat tracking is to take a sequence of digital audio samples representing music as input, and
to return the timestamp of each downbeat (accented beat at the start of each measure).

This folder contains various code fragments used in reproducing the paper.
